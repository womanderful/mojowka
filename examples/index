## Welcome to mojowka-didi

Mojowka-didi is a small and simple wiki implementation based on mojowka (which in turn is based on Mojolicious::Lite).

There is no setup needed. No database or user authentication.

It's intended for personal note-taking, "to do" lists, and any other uses you can think of. You can write articles in plain text or markdown.
